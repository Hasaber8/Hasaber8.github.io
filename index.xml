Which can be installed on your Windows/MacOS X/Linux computer!  Installation  For Windows Computers go ahead and download the Git client from https://git-scm.com/download/win , just accept all the permissions basically keep clicking ok until the installation is done, don’t change anything you don’t know. For Linux Computers just open terminal and type  “sudo apt-get install git” and enter, git will be installed in 1-2 minutes according to you internet connection.</description>

      <title>Opensource and Monetization</title>

      <description>Seems like these don’t go hand in hand, does it?
Lemme view it from my perspective.
Recently there was an android kernel developer who tried to monetize his kernel in the most inappropriate way possible. It became disastrous and he became a meme in that process. He was forced to leave development, forever.
So, is monetizing opensource software cancerous?
Red Hat is the global leader in open source software solutions — and has a clear strategy in how to generate revenue.</description>
