      <description>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency, which can be installed on your Windows/MacOS X/Linux computer! About Version Control What is “version control”, and why should you care?

      <title>Opensource and Monetization</title>

      <description>Seems like these don’t go hand in hand, does it?

So, is monetizing opensource software cancerous?
Red Hat is the global leader in open source software solutions — and has a clear strategy in how to generate revenue.</description>
