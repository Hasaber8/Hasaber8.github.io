# Hey there! 👋

**CS @ Northeastern University, Boston**

I'm Rohan Hasabe, a 22-year-old student currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science @ Northeastern University, Boston. I previously worked at Esper as an SDE II.

This is my personal space on the web where I share my thoughts, projects, and learnings.

If you find someone with the username `Hasaber8` on any platform, you can be mostly sure it's me.
