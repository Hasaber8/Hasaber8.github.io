I am Baalaji Balasubramani, popularly known around the internet world as baalajimaestro. My main in­ter­est, is Android for the past few years now, I have a great passion towards coding, automating stuff(basically I am lazy), kernel hacking(not the hacking you think about). I build Android ROMs like #JustAnotherBuildBot

I mostly contribute to [Telegram UserBot](https://github.com/baalajimaestro/Telegram-UserBot)


It's hard to see me without writing or thinking about code, even if you happen to do so, I would have been sleeping or gaming!

If you ﬁnd some­one with the user­name baalajimaestro on any platform, you can be mostly sure its me
