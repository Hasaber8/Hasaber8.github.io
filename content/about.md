Hey! I'm Rohan Hasabe, a 24-year-old student currently pursuing my master's degree in CS @ Northeastern University, Boston. I previously worked at Esper as an SDE II.

If you find someone with the username `Hasaber8` on any platform, you can be mostly sure it's me.

✨ P.S. 
I’m graduating in May 2026 and am open to roles in general software engineering, backend, and AI tooling!
