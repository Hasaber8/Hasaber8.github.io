This post serves as an announcement to the new bugtracker service I have started to use.

This is an unified bugtracker for all projects I work on. People need to report bugs here so that it can be looked after by any of the devs.

Well, the login creds for the issue tracker are as follows.

`Username: issue@issue.com`

`Password: issue`

Report the bug at the right project. It will assigned and looked after as soon as possible.

Have a nice day!
