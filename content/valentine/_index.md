My Dearest Lavi,

Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream come true. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your love makes my heart skip a beat. As Valentine's Day approaches, I want to ask you something special...

Will you be my Valentine? 🌹

You're not just my girlfriend, you're my best friend, my partner in crime, and the most amazing person I know. Your kindness, your humor, and your beautiful soul make every day feel magical.

I promise to:
- Hold your hand through all of life's adventures
- Make you laugh even on the cloudiest days
- Be your biggest supporter and your safest haven
- Love you more with each passing day

What do you say? Will you make me the happiest person by being my Valentine? 💝

With all my love,
Rohan
